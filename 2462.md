# 2462: Total Cost to Hire K Workers

## Solution

class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs, k, candidates):
        pq1, pq2 = [], []
        left = 0
        right = len(costs) - 1

        ans = 0
        while k > 0:
            while len(pq1) < candidates and left <= right:
                heapq.heappush(pq1, costs[left])
                left += 1
            while len(pq2) < candidates and left <= right:
                heapq.heappush(pq2, costs[right])
                right -= 1

            t1 = pq1[0] if pq1 else float('inf')
            t2 = pq2[0] if pq2 else float('inf')

            if t1 <= t2:
                ans += t1
                heapq.heappop(pq1)
            else:
                ans += t2
                heapq.heappop(pq2)

            k -= 1
        return ans
