# 1575: Count All Possible Routes

## Intuition

1. We need to count all possible paths from `start` to `finish` city with limited `fuel`.
2. We start from a given city and move to other city from the `locations` array. The starting city is not present in the `locations` array and we can't move to it. We can move to any other city multiple times.
3. We start with initial `fuel`, and the cost of travelling from city A to city B in the `locations` array is `|indexOf(A) - indexOf(B)|`.
4. We can move from one city to another only when `|indexOf(nextCity) - indexOf(currentCity)| <= remainingFuel`
5. We can write a recursive function which takes the `currentCity`, `finishCity`, `remainingFuel` and the `locations` array as its parameters.

## Recursive approach

> Result: TLE

```python
class Solution:
    def countRoutes(self, locations: List[int], start: int, finish: int, fuel: int) -> int:
        return self.solve(locations, start, finish, fuel)

    MOD = 1000000007

    def solve(self, locations, currentCity, finishCity, remainingFuel):
        if remainingFuel < 0:
            return 0

        count = 1 if finishCity == currentCity else 0

        for nextCity in range(len(locations)):
            if nextCity != currentCity and remainingFuel >= abs(locations[currentCity] - locations[nextCity]):
                count = (count + self.solve(locations, nextCity, finishCity, remainingFuel - abs(locations[currentCity] - locations[nextCity]))) % self.MOD

        return count
```

## Memoizing the Recursive Approach

> Result: Pass

```python
class Solution:
    def countRoutes(self, locations: List[int], start: int, finish: int, fuel: int) -> int:
        memo = [[None] * (fuel + 1) for _ in range(len(locations))]
        return self.solve(locations, start, finish, fuel, memo)

    MOD = 1000000007

    def solve(self, locations, currentCity, finishCity, remainingFuel, memo):
        if remainingFuel < 0:
            return 0

        if memo[currentCity][remainingFuel] is not None:
            return memo[currentCity][remainingFuel]

        count = 1 if finishCity == currentCity else 0

        for nextCity in range(len(locations)):
            if nextCity != currentCity and remainingFuel >= abs(locations[currentCity] - locations[nextCity]):
                count = (count + self.solve(locations, nextCity, finishCity, remainingFuel - abs(locations[currentCity] - locations[nextCity]), memo)) % self.MOD

        memo[currentCity][remainingFuel] = count
        return count
```
